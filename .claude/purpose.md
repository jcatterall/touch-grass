# TouchGrass

An Android app blocker designed to help you reclaim your time and mental well-being. The way that this works, is by blocking your selected apps until you've either walked a certain distance or a certain amount of time.

## Purpose

- **Reduce screen addiction** - Block social media and other apps that fuel anxiety or procrastination
- **Reclaim wasted time** - Limit access to apps that aren't helping you achieve your goals
- **Improve mental health** - Create intentional breaks from digital distractions

## Features
- Plans: users create plans which define the apps they want to block, over which days (Monday -> Sunday), what time it should apply to (Entire day or specific range) and criteria of how it should be blocked. The current criteria is a certain distance (mi/km), certain time (mins) or permantly blocked (always), once this criteria is met then the apps will be unblocked for the rest of the day.
- Tracking: background, foreground & terminated app activity tracking, triggered by the motion detection and records the appended activity for the day (distance / time)
- Motion detection: detect whether a user is moving (walking/running/cycling), this then triggers the tracking to begin or stop
- Metrics: daily / weekly metrics of users activity, app usage, etc

## Considerations
