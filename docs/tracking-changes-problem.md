I have two potential issues:
1) I don't think the UI is correctly displaying the current state of the motion & whether it's currently tracking AS it changes, this was the case on both the notification & the homscreen - it should be fully reactive
2) The motion was triggered by just walking around the house - can we make it slightly less sensitive?
3) After the motion was triggered, I was in bed and the UI was still showing that it was tracking - are we sure that the idle is stopping the tracking properly? if we think it is, then it's likely just that the UI isn't correctly showing the state

Do the investigation and put together a plan for a prompt that I can pass to Claude to handle the work
