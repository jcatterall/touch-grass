Looking at these illustrations, here's the style breakdown and a Midjourney prompt template:

Style Analysis
Isometric 3D perspective with clean geometric forms
Bold black outlines with consistent stroke weight
Flat colors - no gradients, limited palette
Halftone dot patterns for shadows and ground texture (key signature element)
Mid-century modern editorial aesthetic
Minimalist compositions with strong negative space
Speech bubble motifs and stacked book elements
Midjourney Prompt Template

isometric illustration of [YOUR SUBJECT], bold black outlines, flat color fill, halftone dot pattern shadows, mid-century modern editorial style, limited color palette of meadow green #4F7942 and terracotta #E2725B and oatmeal #F5F5DC and sky blue #87CEEB and charcoal #2F2F2F, clean geometric shapes, minimalist composition, vintage educational poster aesthetic, no gradients --ar 1:1 --stylize 250 --v 6.1
Example Usage

isometric illustration of a person hiking with a backpack near mountains, bold black outlines, flat color fill, halftone dot pattern shadows, mid-century modern editorial style, limited color palette of meadow green #4F7942 and terracotta #E2725B and oatmeal #F5F5DC and sky blue #87CEEB and charcoal #2F2F2F, clean geometric shapes, minimalist composition, vintage educational poster aesthetic, no gradients --ar 1:1 --stylize 250 --v 6.1
Replace [YOUR SUBJECT] with whatever you need - the halftone dots and isometric perspective are the most distinctive elements to preserve.

Update the prompt to be optimised for mobile apps and have no background
Updated Midjourney Prompt Template (Mobile App Optimized)

isometric illustration of [YOUR SUBJECT], bold black outlines, flat color fill, halftone dot pattern shadows, mid-century modern editorial style, limited color palette of meadow green #4F7942 and terracotta #E2725B and oatmeal #F5F5DC and sky blue #87CEEB and charcoal #2F2F2F, clean geometric shapes, isolated subject, centered composition, white background, no gradients, app icon style, simple minimal design --ar 1:1 --stylize 250 --v 6.1
Key Changes
Mobile Optimization	Purpose
isolated subject	Clean edges for easy background removal
centered composition	Works well in app cards/buttons
white background	Easy to remove or integrate into UI
app icon style	Simpler, readable at small sizes
simple minimal design	Reduces clutter for mobile contexts
Example

isometric illustration of a hiking boot with leaves, bold black outlines, flat color fill, halftone dot pattern shadows, mid-century modern editorial style, limited color palette of meadow green #4F7942 and terracotta #E2725B and oatmeal #F5F5DC and sky blue #87CEEB and charcoal #2F2F2F, clean geometric shapes, isolated subject, centered composition, white background, no gradients, app icon style, simple minimal design --ar 1:1 --stylize 250 --v 6.1
After generation, you can easily remove the white background in Figma, Photoshop, or remove.bg for true transparency.
