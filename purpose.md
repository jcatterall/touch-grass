# TouchGrass

An Android app blocker designed to help you reclaim your time and mental well-being. The way that this works, is by blocking your selected apps until you've either walked a certain distance or a certain amount of time.

## Purpose

- **Reduce screen addiction** - Block social media and other apps that fuel anxiety or procrastination
- **Reclaim wasted time** - Limit access to apps that aren't helping you achieve your goals
- **Improve mental health** - Create intentional breaks from digital distractions

## Platform

Android only (for now)
